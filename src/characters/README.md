# Character Creation
Hawkmoth Country contains some new character creation options specific to the world it takes place in, but most of the options present in the Cypher System Rulebook are compatible as well.

All four of the types present in the Cypher System Rulebook are available as-is. They have, however, been renamed to 
represent how Strangers refer to members of each Type. They are:
+ Heart (Warrior)
+ Head (Adept)
+ Eye (Explorer)
+ Tongue (Speaker)

Players may also swap out abilities in their characterâ€™s Type for the abilities in a Flavor of their choice, using the rules 
described in Chapter 6 of the Cypher System Rulebook. Technology Flavor may not be chosen.

Every descriptor present in the Cypher System Rulebook is playable in Hawkmoth Country.

Most Foci from the Cypher System Rulebook are playable in Hawkmoth Country. However, the following Foci are not a good fit 
for the setting. They should only be allowed by GMs that feel very strongly about their inclusion, or are making unique 
assumptions about the world or time period of their campaign.
