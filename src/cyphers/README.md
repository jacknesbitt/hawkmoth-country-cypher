Cyphers in this context are called Boons, and they represent the mercurial, sometimes fleeting ways that the Power manifests in people. Boons are always Subtle Cyphers.

In the world of Hawkmoth Country, the Power creates thin threads of pure possibility called Leylines that crisscross the globe, affecting the flow of events in unexpected ways. Whenever a player comes across a spot where several Leylines converge, the GM should indicate that they may draw Power from the Convergence. To do so, a player should follow the rules on page 379 of the Cypher System Rulebook for Discovering Subtle Cyphers â€“ specifically the sections for **General Cypher** and **Specific Cypher**. A player who chooses to draw from a Convergence does not have to spend any XP to do so.

Conveniently enough for player characters, Convergences are assumed to exist in places important to the kinds of stories that are typical of a Hawkmoth Country campaign. The nature of the Power simply makes Leylines more likely to converge in places where interesting stuff is happening.

At the discretion of the GM, players may also pull a Boon from surrounding wells of the Power by spending 1 XP at any time.
